realist example usecase
=======================


This document describes the realist API using a bunch of example use cases.

Realist aims at being the network based representation for everything you
think about and you want to keep in mind.

Realist follows the GTD approach to organize your thaughts and to get things
done and thus there should be only one medium for everything - for your 
ideas as well as tasks you have to keep in mind and get handled.

First thing we want to do is write down everything that comes to mind and
organize it later.
