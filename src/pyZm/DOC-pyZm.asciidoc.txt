python interface to zeitmaschine
================================

1. aim and todo
---------------

The SWIG based python bindings for zeitmaschine exist for two reasons:

First of all of course Python is a great language and I want to be able
to use zeimaschine features from within Python.

The second reason is I believe that providing generic interfaces to your
library makes it better.
* the interface becomes cleaner because it makes less use of tricky
  error prone technology
* the file stucture becomes more modular
* different environments let hidden design flaws and bugs become visible

Last but not least I want to make use of asciitest bringing working real
life examples which also act as tests into your documentation.
