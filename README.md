zeitmaschine - augment your mind
================================

This project aims to organize what you have to keep in mind. This is tasks,
lists, notes, contacts and the relations between everything.

There are lots of GTD and note keeping tool out there you might think now and
you're right!

But I want it to be private, distributed, universal, extendible and free.

* platform independent (at least for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS)
* parallelly usable across multiple different devices (without  collisions of course)
* usable offline without limitations
* host encrypted
* self hosted
* open source
