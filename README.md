zeitmaschine - augment your mind
================================

This project aims to organize what you have to keep in mind. This is tasks,
lists, notes, contacts and the relations between everything.

There are lots of GTD and note keeping tools out there you might think now
and you're right!

But for me it's very important to keep private things private and I want
a universal, free and extendible tool.


must have attributes

Since there are lots of tools for the mentioned tasks, so let's list up the

* platform independent (at least for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS)
* parallelly usable across multiple different devices (without  collisions of course)
* usable offline without limitations
* host encrypted
* self hosted
* open source
